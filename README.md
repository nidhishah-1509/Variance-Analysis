# Variance-Analysis
The Material Variance Analysis project is a web-based tool designed to help users evaluate material price, usage, mix, and yield variances in manufacturing. It provides an interactive calculator where users can input standard and actual prices and quantities for different materials to analyze cost deviations and identify inefficiencies.

This project aims to enhance material cost control by computing key variances. Price variance measures the impact of price fluctuations, usage variance highlights differences in material consumption, mix variance assesses proportional changes in material combinations, and yield variance evaluates output efficiency based on inputs. 

The user interface is clean and intuitive, featuring a dropdown selector for choosing the number of materials. Users enter the required values, and JavaScript functions dynamically compute and display variances. The tool also allows for report generation, enabling users to download a summary of their analysis in PDF format.

This project is beneficial for manufacturing firms analyzing production efficiency, accounting and finance students learning about variance analysis, and small businesses aiming for better cost control and budgeting. By integrating financial analysis with web development and automation, this tool provides a practical solution for improving decision-making in material cost management.
